178
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:22,241
What have you been doing?
Lounging in some internet cafe?

179
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:24,452
-Can you believe it?
-Such a bad boy.

180
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,036
You're not helping!

181
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,458
Why do this? You're a good student!
You could ruin your future.

182
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:34,044
-True. There goes the college degree.
-You're not helping!

183
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,379
-I just--
-Just what?

184
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,715
I was just doing a little side job.

185
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,133
Side job?

186
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:42,303
You have one job, and one job only.
That is to study.

187
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:44,096
-I know, but--
-But what?

188
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,683
What could possibly
be more important than studying?

189
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,144
Nothing, Mom.

190
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,146
Nothing.

191
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,525
-This is getting juicy.
-What did he say? I can't hear.

192
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,902
You're not helping!

193
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:02,865
-I know I'm hard on you, but I'm--
-You're right, Mom.

194
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:04,784
You're right.

195
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,305
[man 1] It's there?

196
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,432
This can't be right.

197
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:32,144
-Uh, what are we looking for again?
-A teapot!

198
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,896
[man 2] Open the door.

199
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:40,903
[short man yelps]

200
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,537
Good evening, gentlemen.

201
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,539
This area's off-limits.

202
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,374
Can I help you?

203
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:56,043
Yes, I believe you can.

204
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:57,545
[grunting]

205
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,881
Stop! Stop! Stop right there.

206
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:04,176
-Put your hands where I can see them.
-Oh…

207
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:08,180
I'm afraid that's not going to happen.

208
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:10,891
-Uh… Okay, sir.
-You first, man.

209
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:15,229
-You're under arrest.
-Hold on a minute, there. [grunting]

210
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:20,442
Ow.

211
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:21,402
Huh?

212
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,332
[snoring]

213
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,759
I'll fix that later.

214
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,845
[bright, whimsical music plays]

215
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:55,853
Whoa!

216
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,620
Aiya. She's late again.

217
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:14,747
[exhales] Okay.

218
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:18,083
[clears throat, hums]

219
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,003
Oh, uh…

220
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,797
What? Oh, that old thing.

221
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:27,301
[chuckles softly]

222
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:28,677
-[buzzing]
-Huh?

223
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,971
Well, well, well.

224
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,807
Look who decided to show up.

225
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,061
Starting to take me for granted, huh?

226
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,230
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

227
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:43,025
So, what do you think of the suit?

228
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:47,071
Good enough to get into the birthday party
of the famous Li Na Wang?

229
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:49,198
Good.

230
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:50,783
I think so too.

231
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,495
Okay, Din, tomorrow's the big day.

232
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:57,414
How are we gonna do this?
What am I gonna say?

233
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:03,045
Happy birthday, it's your best friend Din!
No, that's too strong.

234
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:06,799
Good evening, Li Na.

235
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:09,009
Will you allow me to kiss your hand?

236
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,888
Ugh. Man, quit being a creep, Din.

237
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:16,100
[beatboxing] Huh?

238
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:18,268
Oh yeah, sure, I'll dance with you.

239
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:21,355
Say, you look kind of familiar.

240
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,193
I got you a present. You still like kites?

241
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:28,570
What am I saying?
Of course she still likes kites.

242
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,782
Okay, just… calm down.

243
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:33,867
Be honest.

244
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:37,204
Hey, Li Na. Happy birthday.

245
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,039
I just want to say,

246
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,834
-it's been a long time and…
-[fabric fraying]

247
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,044
…I miss you.

248
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,004
What?

249
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,880
-[gasps] Oh no!
-[fabric rips]

250
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:47,965
Oh, gosh. Um…

251
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:50,050
-Hold on, I can fix this.
-[rips]

252
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,343
Oh, come on.

253
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:52,845
Wha--

254
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:53,929
[exhales sadly]

255
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,273
What was I thinking?

256
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:08,152
No, no, no!

257
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:09,236
Ah…

258
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,321
[melancholy music plays]

259
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:23,083
I must look totally crazy.

260
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:25,210
It's just…

261
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,921
I don't know what else to do.

262
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,759
I can see my whole life
laid out ahead of me,

263
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:36,096
and I'm trying my best,
trying to make everyone proud,

264
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:41,060
but the whole time
it feels like something is missing.

265
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:46,690
I just wish…

266
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:52,446
I just wish I could keep our promise.

267
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,742
[kettle whistling]

268
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:57,701
Tea is ready.

269
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:00,287
Wait, what? The tea is ready?

270
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,289
[whistling]

271
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,875
-Huh?
-[explosion]

272
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,670
Well, that was…

273
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:09,630
[loud boom]

274
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:11,340
[whooshing]

275
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,634
[male voice] Greetings, great master!

276
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:17,638
The heavens have opened,
your wishes will be granted,

277
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:22,643
for I am LongZhu! [echoing]

278
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:23,811
Huh?

279
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:30,901
Oh, a peasant boy.
Well, this'll be easy. [chuckles]

280
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,529
Look, I know what you're thinking.

281
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,197
"Do my eyes deceive me?"

282
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,659
"A super, all-powerful,
magical Wish Dragon!"

283
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:41,453
"Could this be real? Is magic real?"

284
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:43,247
Yes.

285
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:44,706
It's real.

286
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,336
Now that we got that out of the way,
onto the important part.

287
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,298
Am I… am I dead?

288
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,175
Grandma! It's Din!

289
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:58,345
-I fell off the roof. I'm coming for you!
-No, no.

290
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:00,055
No, you're very much alive.

291
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,474
I am a magical Wish Dragon,

292
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:05,853
who will grant three wishes
to the owner of this teapot.

293
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:08,355
And you, sir, are my master!

294
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:10,357
So, go ahead, wish away!

295
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:16,071
Okay, you got me.
Where are the hidden cameras?

296
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,990
-Great joke, guys.
-Joke?

297
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:21,577
-Is this a hologram or something?
-I assure you not.

298
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,829
-[dramatic music rises]
-[Din] Ah!

299
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:27,457
Do you wish for
a suit of armor made of solid gold?

300
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,792
It shall be so.

301
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,879
Do you wish
for the strength of 1,000 men? Boom!

302
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:34,047
-It shall be so.
-Whoa.

303
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,508
For the finest carriage in all the land?

304
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:37,926
Pow! It's yours!

305
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,761
The wings of a hawk!

306
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,013
[caws]

307
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:44,183
Or the legs of a giraffe.
Feels good up here, right?

308
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,350
Or anything else

309
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:49,021
that your heart desires.

310
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:54,109
I'm thinking about starting one of those--

311
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,612
Where they sell animals. Pet-type stores.

312
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:59,531
You going to sell Chow Chows?
That's a good dog.

313
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:03,327
No one will be selling anything
if we don't find that teapot.

314
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:06,622
Every time I try
to make casual conversation,

315
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,415
you guys give me a hard time.

316
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:09,541
Wha--

317
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:14,463
So, you're a Wish Dragon?

318
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:15,422
Yes.

319
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:17,716
How many wishes do I get?

320
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,301
You get three wishes.

321
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:26,099
-How do you fit in this teapot?
-Uh, it's magic. It's a magic teapot.

322
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:27,935
So small. How old are you?

323
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:30,145
-That's not--
-Where'd you come from?

324
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,439
-All you need--
-Look at your arms.

325
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:36,360
Why are you pink? Shouldn't you be green?
Your face is so soft. I want to touch it.

326
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:38,737
Oh, can you breathe fire? [splutters]

327
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,617
Okay. Look, peasant boy.

328
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:47,663
I don't have time.
I'm not here to be your friend--

329
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,082
Whoa, you have to earn my friendship,

330
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:52,542
and frankly you're not doing a good job.

331
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:54,586
Listen carefully.

332
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,005
Every Wish Dragon must serve 10 masters

333
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:00,050
before they're free
to enter the spirit world.

334
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:02,511
And you are the last one.

335
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:03,929
Now, I've been stuck…

336
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:07,557
[high-pitched]
…in this teapot for 1,000 years.

337
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:10,269
The sooner we get this over with,
the better.

338
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,479
[normally] Have I made myself clear?

339
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,189
[footsteps]

340
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,732
Ha! [grunts]

341
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:17,776
Wha--

342
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:23,782
I'm terribly sorry, young man,
but I need that teapot.

343
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,785
Uh, I-- I think it's his.

344
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:29,329
Only the owner of the teapot can see me.

345
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,875
Well, I'm sure he won't miss it.

346
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:38,380
No way. I found it. Whoa!

347
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:41,758
[yelling, grunting]

348
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,720
[dramatic music plays]

349
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,933
[panting]

350
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,442
Not good.

351
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:00,736
I wish I knew how to fight. [grunts]

352
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,447
[henchmen chuckling]

353
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:06,283
Come here.

354
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:09,369
That's a good teapot.

355
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:15,792
Huh?

356
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:16,710
Huh?

357
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:24,134
[henchman groaning
in distorted, slowed-down speed]

358
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:25,218
[Din] Whoa.

359
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:27,596
What the…

360
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:30,349
[henchmen grunting]

361
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:35,187
[gasps] No, no, no, I didn't mean that.

362
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,480
I take it back.

363
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:38,315
Gimme that.

364
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:41,443
Teapot.

365
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:45,489
Give me that teapot right now.

366
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:50,660
Huh? Oh!

367
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:58,210
Whoa, I just kicked through a door!

368
00:22:58,293 --> 00:22:59,294
[Din yelps]

369
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:03,757
Gimme! Gimme! Mine! Mine!

370
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:08,261
[groans]

371
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:13,308
You little twerp!

372
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:21,858
-[menacing music]
-Ah!

373
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:24,861
[knocking at door]

374
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,406
Uh… nobody's home?

375
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:35,747
I'm done asking nicely.

376
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:51,346
[Din yelps]

377
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:58,353
Are you telling me a teenage boy
out-fought two full-grown men?

378
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,730
-Well, sir--
-Actually, three men.

379
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,732
-Two-and-a-half.
-You should have seen him.

380
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,735
It was 1,000 punches a minute.
Kicks everywhere.

381
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:08,613
I've never seen so many arms and legs.

382
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,323
[sighs] This is not good.

383
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:12,701
The boy knows what he has.

384
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:15,162
Sir, if I may ask,

385
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:17,038
what exactly does he have?

386
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:20,917
That's none of your business.
I'm paying you to find it.

387
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:23,670
-That is your only concern.
-You haven't paid.

388
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:27,632
You'll be paid when I have the teapot,
beyond your wildest dreams!

389
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:28,842
Do you understand?

390
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,553
Forgive our incompetence, sir.

391
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:34,431
But the boy did leave something behind.

392
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:37,434
It's only a matter of time
before we find him.

393
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:40,353
[snoring]

394
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:42,856
[snoring, gasping]

395
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:45,150
Din, up now!

396
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:48,778
-[groggily] How about a kick to the face?
-Huh? I said up!

397
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:50,071
[yelps, exclaims]

398
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:54,743
-Ow.
-Breakfast is on the table.

399
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:56,828
Thanks, Mom.

400
00:24:58,246 --> 00:24:59,789
What a crazy dream.

401
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:04,544
[distorted, slowed-down audio]

402
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,218
[Din groans]

403
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:13,595
Din, I'm working late tonight.

404
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,143
So, leftovers for dinner, okay?

405
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:22,604
[Din] Mmm!

406
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:24,731
Delicious.

407
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:28,568
So, leftovers for dinner.

408
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,070
Yeah.

409
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,322
Leftovers.

410
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:36,409
[Din's mom] Aiya.

411
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:39,746
Stupid shoes.

412
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:45,502
Hey Mom, if you could wish for anything,
what would it be?

413
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:49,130
Din, why are you
asking silly questions? Eat.

414
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,049
Okay, but seriously, Mom,

415
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:53,426
if you could wish for anything.

416
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:57,472
-A big house in the countryside?
-Din, we went over this yesterday.

417
00:25:57,556 --> 00:26:00,267
I want you to focus on your future.

418
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,768
That is what I wish for.

419
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:07,732
I'm more focused
than I've ever been in my entire life.

420
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:11,027
Hmm. Good.
Now hurry up. You're gonna be late.

421
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:15,949
-What's that face? I know that.
-I don't have a face. What?

422
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:18,577
Go to school. Stop planning things.

423
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:22,706
[dramatic music plays]

424
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:30,130
Um, hello?

425
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:31,381
Dragon thingy?

426
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:32,549
You in there?

427
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:34,676
[crying out]

428
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:37,012
Excellent work, peasant boy.

429
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:40,265
One wish down, two to go.
We could be done by lunch.

430
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:42,434
What did you do to me?
Why do I know kung fu?

431
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:46,187
You're welcome. You wish you could fight.
I made you a master.

432
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,732
I didn't wish for… Hey, that's not fair.

433
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:49,941
You said "wish."

434
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:54,654
Oh, so just 'cause I said "wish,"
now I'm stuck with these kung fu powers?

435
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:56,406
-[grunts]
-Cool.

436
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:58,325
Yes, it's all very cool.

437
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,410
So, onto that second wish.

438
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:02,829
Let me recommend the all-time favorite.

439
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:05,415
A giant pile of gold!

440
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:08,835
Now, repeat after me.
"I wish for…" You're not talking.

441
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:11,630
"A giant pile of…"
You're not saying anything.

442
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,214
Hey, stop rushing me.

443
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:17,802
Ah, you must be the conquering type.
I see that killer instinct in your eyes.

444
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:21,306
Easy. Just wish for
your very own personal army!

445
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,892
Why would I need an army?

446
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,353
You're quite a simple fellow.

447
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:29,189
Not to worry.
Here's one the peasant-folk love.

448
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:30,357
[yelping]

449
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,109
I can allow you to speak with a loved one

450
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:35,195
on the other side of China!

451
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:39,074
I'm a loved one.
I can't hear you. You're very far away.

452
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:43,161
-There's a wall here. It's cool, but--
-You mean, like, a cell phone?

453
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:44,788
-[ringtone plays]
-Ah!

454
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:46,956
What dark magic is this?

455
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,792
Where is the tiny orchestra?

456
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:51,127
How do they fit in this metal box?

457
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:53,755
Two wishes. Anything I want.

458
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:56,591
[gasps] The birthday party.
I know what I want.

459
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:58,718
Wait, a wish?

460
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,053
Yeah, yeah, a wish.

461
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:01,888
Excellent.

462
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:04,140
[bright, upbeat music plays]

463
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,058
Ah!

464
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:08,895
-[cars honk]
-[plane whooshes]

465
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,606
A giant metal bird?

466
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:16,861
-What are you doing?
-Uh, riding my magical Wish Dragon. Away!

467
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:20,031
What are you doing?

468
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:22,951
If you're not gonna let me ride you,
we catch the bus.

469
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:25,286
The "bus"?
Is that some kind of animal?

470
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:29,582
-How long have you been in that teapot?
-Is it still the Qing Dynasty?

471
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,167
-Ooh!
-Long!

472
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:33,461
How did you get in there?

473
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:36,631
Don't ignore me when I'm talking, peasant.

474
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:39,050
It's not a little man. It's television.

475
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:40,969
What's this?

476
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:43,096
[Din] Car.

477
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:45,724
Ah, the spoils of war on display?

478
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:49,728
-What is this invisible force--
-[Din] Glass!

479
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,896
-What purpose--
-Stop light.

480
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,940
-What in the world?
-Ice cream.

481
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:55,650
-How is this--
-Electricity.

482
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,027
-I know it's all amazing--
-Amazing?

483
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:00,530
When you've been around
as long as I have,

484
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:03,491
there's nothing in this world
that could amaze--

485
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,994
"Shrimp chips."

486
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,454
Peasant food, no doubt.

487
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:10,081
[chewing loudly]

488
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:11,791
[gasps]

489
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,460
Magnificent!

490
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:16,629
Okay, we're here.

491
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:20,717
-You gonna make a wish now?
-I will. Just wait until we get there.

492
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,218
-Get where?
-[horn honks]

493
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:24,095
Great Wall of China!

494
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:27,474
A giant chariot made of steel and glass!

495
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:29,267
Long, this is bus. Come on.

496
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,935
-Out of the way.
-My word!

497
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:33,563
[chicken clucking]

498
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:37,066
-And watch your step. Carefully.
-Thank you, kind sir.

[Din grunting]

500
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:42,655
-No. There must be a better…
-Long, what are you doing?

501
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:44,949
[Long] Ah!

502
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,367
That's more like it.

503
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:48,995
Long, what are you doing?

504
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:50,789
Getting a personal carriage.

505
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:55,418
I can't afford a personal carriage,
which is why we were taking the bus.

506
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,170
Did you just steal my money?

507
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,173
-…we won't make the express.
-Here.

508
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:03,426
-Hey, where did you get this?
-You know, magic.

[chuckles]

510
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,599
I, uh, had a really big lunch.

511
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,315
This is more like it!

512
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:19,275
[splutters, yelps]

513
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:21,277
Huh?

514
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,155
Uh, what is this?

515
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,448
Traffic.

516
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:26,407
Traffic.

517
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:29,327
-That some kind of national holiday?
-Ha!

518
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:35,667
You mean to tell me this happens
every single day?

519

[Long groans]

521
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:43,383
The sun is moving faster than us.

522
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:47,345
This is worse than my teapot.

523
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:52,141
Ugh! I'm never going to make it in time.
I wish this traffic would just--

524
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,351
Yes, go ahead.

525
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:55,979
Long, I'm not gonna
waste a wish on traffic!

526
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:59,065
-Look, Din, you're gonna have to use--
-[honking]

527
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:00,567
You're gonna have to--

528
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,193
You're going to have to--

529
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:05,154
-You're gonna have to use--
-[honks]

530
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:06,072
Use a wish!

531
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:09,617
You son of a cabbage farmer!
There is no place to go!

532
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:13,913
Blow your trumpet all you want.
It won't make any difference at all!

533
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:16,749
You know, Long,
we'll get there eventually.

534
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:19,377
Even if it takes all day.

535
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:20,962
All day?

536
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:24,257
I heard one traffic jam
lasted three weeks. [sighs]

537
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:27,343
If only I had
a magical dragon that could fly.

538
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,554
I know what you're trying. Not gonna work.

539
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:33,766
I spent 1,000 years in that teapot.
I can spend hours in your traffic.

540
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:38,271
Hey, I got an idea. Why don't we listen
to the tiny orchestra while we wait?

541
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:39,772
[jaunty ring tone plays]

542
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:41,065
Not gonna work, Din.

543
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,151
[ring tone continues]

544
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:45,236
Use your wish, Din.

545
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:55,622
[indistinct chatter from TV]

546
00:31:56,706 --> 00:32:00,585
-[overlapping chatter]
-[honking]

547
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:05,632
[Long] Fine!

548
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:07,717
[Din] Ah!

549
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:09,636
[yelping]

550
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:25,068
Careful what you don't wish for.

551
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:28,696
-Push me too far, I will not hesitate to--
-Fly everywhere?

552
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:32,033
You're amazing! Look.
Is there anything you can't do?

553
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:35,119
Well, that's very-- Ah!

554
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,121
[plane whooshes]

555
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:40,333
[chuckles awkwardly]
Anyways, where are we going?

556
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:42,085
Ah, there it is! Down there.

557
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:44,003
[energetic music plays]

558
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,797
[Din cheering]

559
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:49,300
We're here.

560
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,135
-Wishing time.
-Ah!

561
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:54,138
Excellent.
I see where this is going.

562
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:57,600
Now, when choosing a palace,
it is very important that--

563
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:01,688
Uh, what are you do--

564
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:04,607
-[groans]
-Quit goofing off. This is serious.

565
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:06,693
Okay, what's the wish?

566
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:07,944
Okay, you see her?

567
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:09,153
Hi, good evening.

568
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:11,948
-Thank you for coming.
-Li Na, happy birthday.

569
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:12,865
How are you?

570
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,576
That's my second wish, Long.

571
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,745
-I wish--
-Stop, stop, stop!

572
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:21,207
-I can't do love.
-What? No, Long, it's not--

573
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:24,252
Couple of rules.
I can't time travel, I can't kill,

574
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:28,464
and it pains me to inform you, not really,
I can't make people fall in love with you.

575
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:31,259
No, no, no, it's not like that, Long.

576
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,844
She's my best friend.

577
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:34,137
That's my wish.

578
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:36,514
I want my friend back.

579
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:42,937
Wait, rewind. You can wish
for anything in the whole world,

580
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,731
and you waste it on a friend?

581
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:47,191
What could be more important?

582
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:51,195
-Is that a trick question?
-No.

583
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,947
Literally anything else.

584
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:57,285
Let me think, a golden chamber pot,
a palace made entirely of jade,

585
00:33:57,368 --> 00:34:01,664
an army of terracotta warriors!
Why are you wasting a wish on some girl?

586
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:05,251
Oh! That's right.

587
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:07,795
Sorry, I can't expect you to understand.

588
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,715
I haven't explained everything.
Down, please.

589
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:16,721
Ten years ago, a cool spring day.
A gentle breeze.

590
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:20,099
A lonely boy waits after school. Me.

591
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:24,645
Enter the girl, Li Na, throwing dumplings
and defending my honor. Then we…

592
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:28,066
[Long] This is really happening.
This should be so easy.

593
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:32,820
Three wishes and I'm done.
But no, I get stuck with this simpleton.

594
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:35,406
Just look at him with his mindless grin.

595
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,909
So naive. So ignorant.

596
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:39,869
So stupid.

597
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:41,454
Why?

598
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:43,998
What have I done to deserve this?

599
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:48,086
And then she drove away
and I never saw her again.

600
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:54,050
It's okay, Long. I get emotional too
just talking about it.

601
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,511
[groaning]

602
00:34:56,594 --> 00:35:01,015
I can't make people fall in love.
Why would I make someone your friend?

603
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:05,103
What? No, she's already my friend.
I just need to get into the party.

604
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:07,355
A wish! Why didn't you just say so?

605
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,398
Yeah, I wish to be a princeling.

606
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:12,819
All right, here we go.
Stand back and it shall be so!

607
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:13,903
[whoosh, poof]

608
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,740
Done and done. Now, onto that final wish.

609
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,075
[neighs]

610
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:21,702
What is this?

611
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:25,206
What? I made you a prince.

612
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,542
No, no, I said princeling.

613
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:30,336
Like one of those guys
with the fancy suit,

614
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:32,755
the Rolex watch
and the chauffeured car,

615
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:35,258
-the personal assistant--
-[splutters]

616
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:38,261
That's like ten different wishes.
You have two.

617
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:41,764
Fine. How about a temporary version,
just for today?

618
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:45,184
You're seriously going to wish
to be rich for 24 hours?

619
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:46,727
I don't care about that.

620
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:50,857
I just need to reconnect with Li Na.
She won't care if I'm poor.

621
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,693
[laughs] I'm sorry I'm laughing,

622
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:58,281
but that is the dumbest thing
I've ever heard. Of course she'll care.

623
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:01,409
Yeah, well, it's my wish and not yours.

624
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,369
Shoot me with your magic juice.

625
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:06,831
Fine, 24 hours.

626
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,084
Perfect!

627
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,586
And the car.

628
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:14,839
Whoa.

629
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:15,756
Perfect.

630
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:20,511
And the personal assistant who has to do
everything I ask for the next 24 hours.

631
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,180
[groans]

632
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:29,604
Long, you look good as a human.
Now, walking can be tricky, but--

633
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:32,565
Okay, party time.

634
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:34,442
[tires screech]

635
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,283
Oh, uh.

636
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:47,288
[bald man] Good afternoon.
I'd like to inquire about a customer.

637
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,790
[clerk] Sorry, I can't give out… [grunts]

638
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:56,714
Follow me.

639
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,596
[tires screech]

640
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:08,851
[triumphant music plays]

641
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,397
[all gasp]

642
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:16,984
[chuckles] Oh, yeah.
Now, these are my kind of people.

643
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,362
The servants' entrance is around back.

644
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:23,783
[classical music plays]

645
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:25,243
Whoa.

646
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,245
This is amazing.

647
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:29,372
Oh, you got in.

648
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:32,875
-I've never been so humiliated in--
-Coat check, thank you.

649
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:36,045
There she is.

650
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:37,880
She looks so…

651
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:39,757
important.

652
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,677
-Li Na.
-It's so good to see you again.

653
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,012
How does it feel to be 19, dear?

654
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:48,975
Oh, well, I've actually been feeling
really confused lately--

655
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:53,479
Great, dear. What would you say
about being the new face of Shin Makeup?

656
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:57,108
Actually, I no longer rep products
that use animal testing.

657
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:59,443
-Where's your father?
-Li Na?

658
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,445
I'll have him sign the contract.

659
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:03,990
-Li Na!
-It's so great to see you again!

660
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:06,033
I want to talk about your future.

661
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:08,202
I've been thinking about my future.

662
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:12,248
Inflatable bras, the future of fashion.
I want you to be a part.

663
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:14,667
-Yeah, I'm not sure--
-That's great!

664
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,877
I'll have a shoot scheduled ASAP.

665
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:20,089
-Happy birthday!
-It's so-- Oh, it's you, Buckley.

666
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:23,175
We're halfway through the list.
You're doing great.

667
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:25,720
Yeah, great. Any word from my dad?

668
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:28,055
He's working hard, just like we are.

669
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,641
So, how about a little bit less of this,

670
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,059
and more of this!

671
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,395
All right, Din. [exhales] Here we go.

672
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:36,605
Got it. Game face.

673
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,941
-Whoo. Here we go!
-Hi, Li Na! Happy--

674
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:41,360
Hi, it's so great to see you again.

675
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:46,198
-Oh, i feel that same way. So--
-This is just the greatest day of my life.

676
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:47,950
Uh, wow, you too?

677
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:51,537
Uh, wait, before I forget,
I brought you a little something.

678
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:55,291
-Hi, it's so good to see you again.
-Actually, we never met.

679
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:58,085
-If I may?
-Hi, it's so great to see you again.

680
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:03,257
So, how's your best friend?

681
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,760
I… I don't know what happened.

682
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,595
She didn't even recognize me.

683
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:10,473
Great. Dreams crushed.
We're done here, right?

684
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:11,932
I'll have two to go.

685
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:15,019
[emcee] Ladies and gentlemen,
time for a treat.

686
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:18,939
If we could have the birthday girl
and her father come to the dance floor…

687
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,316
There she is.

688
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:24,153
And now her father, Mr. Wang,
come to the stage.

689
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:25,821
Calling Mr. Wang!

690
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:28,366
-Come on, Dad. Don't be shy.
-Mr. Wang?

691
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:30,451
Mr. Wang, come on down!

692
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:33,037
I'm sure he'll be here any second.

693
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,413
Mr. Wang.

694
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:36,415
Wang? Do I have the right name?

695
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:40,252
What kind of father doesn't show up
to his daughter's birthday?

696
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:42,046
-[man 2] I know.
-Come on.

697
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:45,424
-We gotta do something.
-[emcee] Mic was on. I apologize.

698
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:49,387
[Din] Ladies and gentlemen,
if I could have your attention here.

699
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,931
It's time for the entertainment portion.

700
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:53,849
Long, make some smoke. Lights.

701
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,851
[electronic music playing]

702
00:39:55,935 --> 00:40:00,523
[Din] From the streets of Shaolin,
kung fu like you've never seen it before.

703
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:03,943
Introducing the great master!

704
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:05,194
[whoosh]

705
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:06,654
[crowd gasps, applauds]

706
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,989
Trained in the art of Dragon Style.

707
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,408
[crowd] Ooh!

708
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:22,253
Now, everyone,
keep your eyes on the stage as I…

709
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,175
[exclaiming]

710
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,595
[applause, cheering]

711
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:40,271
Uh, that's it.
Show's over. Thank you, folks. Bye!

712
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:41,939
Personal assistant.

713
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:43,816
Never been so insulted.

714
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:45,401
Lucky number eight!

715
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:49,488
Sir, caviar crème anglaise amuse-bouche?

716
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:52,575
You don't have
any, uh, shrimp chips, do you?

717
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:54,201
Uh, no.

718
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:56,954
[mockingly] No. [hiccups]

719
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,539
Oh, no.

720
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:01,333
What's a man like you
doing all by himself?

721
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:06,255
So true. Who needs wine
when you have good company?

722
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:08,841
I believe you've misunder-- [hiccups]

723
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:12,136
[laughs] I don't normally
move this fast, but…

724
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,055
Sorry, must run.

725
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:17,099
Hello…

726
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:19,852
Li Na?

727
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:23,314
Oh, handsome?

728
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:26,567
Playing hard to get, I see.

729
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:31,530
Water. Water. I just need water.

730
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:33,616
[panting]

731
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:37,203
[sighs in relief]

732
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:42,291
Refreshing.

733
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:51,133
[spluttering]

734
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:54,720
Where's that kid?

735
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:09,276
Hello?

736
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:13,405
-Li Na, is that you?
-Go away. I'm busy.

737
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:16,450
Ah, yeah, I can see you're busy.

738
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:18,077
Yes, very busy.

739
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,079
Okay, I… I just…

740
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:24,708
I'm the one who did
that whole kung fu thing.

741
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:27,086
I was just trying to…

742
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:31,590
I know what you were trying to do.

743
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:34,343
Thanks.

744
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:40,558
[muffled crying]

745
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:42,518
Are you okay?

746
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:45,187
Yeah.

747
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:46,772
I'm fine.

748
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:48,857
[Li Na sobbing]

749
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:51,068
Here, take this.

750
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:52,528
Thank you.

751
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:53,946
[Li Na blowing nose]

752
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:55,614
[Li Na blows nose]

753
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:02,663
Just… just one night
out of the whole year,

754
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:05,708
I thought maybe he could make time.

755
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:09,211
I don't know why I'm letting it get to me.

756
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:10,879
I'm sorry.

757
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:14,883
This is so embarrassing.
I don't normally cry like this.

758
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:22,474
Here, you got a little something
on your face.

759
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:28,564
Yeah, it's not really coming off.

760
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:33,402
[gasps] I'm sorry.
I must look totally crazy.

761
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:35,279
No, no.

762
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:39,199
I just… don't know what else to do.

763
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:44,288
It's like, I can see my whole life
laid out ahead of me,

764
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:48,542
and I'm trying my best,
trying to make everyone proud,

765
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:52,421
but… no matter how hard I try,
I just feel like…

766
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:54,590
Like…

767
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:56,425
[both] Something is missing.

768
00:43:58,802 --> 00:43:59,637
Exactly.

769
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,139
[poignant music plays]

770
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:06,852
[woman] There you are, snake eyes.

771
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:10,981
I'm sorry, do I--

772
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:12,608
Oh! Ah!

773
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:14,485
Oh, jeez, are you okay?

774
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:16,111
I'm fine.

775
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:18,072
[both laugh]

776
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:18,989
Here.

777
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:21,700
Thanks.

778
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:27,790
I'm sorry for being so rude.
I don't think I got your name earlier.

779
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:30,709
Have we met before?

780
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:34,171
Um, well, actually…

781
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:36,382
I'm--

782
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:39,176
There you are. Miss Wang, thank goodness.

783
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:42,346
Just in time.
Your father will be here any second.

784
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:44,556
-He made it?
-Uh, yes.

785
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:47,351
[tablet chimes]

786
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:50,145
Li Na! There you are.

787
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:54,274
-Oh. Hi, Dad.
-Buckley informs me the party was perfect.

788
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:56,985
Oh! Uh, yes, it was.

789
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:59,279
-Thank you, Dad.
-You had a good time?

790
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:02,366
Yes, of course.
I spoke to everyone you wanted me to

791
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:07,162
and I think I was able to make
some really important… connections.

792
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:10,666
Hello? Hello? Ah, there we go.

793
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:13,210
Here, I brought you something special.

794
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:15,629
-[clears throat]
-Oh! Uh…

795
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,881
-Here you are.
-Go ahead. Open it!

796
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:21,552
I had to send my assistant
to half the jewelers in Shanghai.

797
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:22,594
It's true.

798
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:26,390
-I know you appreciate something special.
-Oh, of course.

799
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:28,892
Just as much as last year.

800
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:29,935
Thank you, Dad.

801
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:33,814
Oh, uh, did I?
Na Na, I'm sorry. You know, I--

802
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:37,526
Well, you can never have too much
of a good thing, right?

803
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:40,654
Excuse me,
I… I didn't see you there, young man.

804
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:43,198
Allow me to get you a closer look, sir.

805
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:45,117
Here you are.

806
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:49,913
[Mr. Wang] Good quality leather,
excellent suit, Rolex.

807
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:52,541
And what's the family business?

808
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:54,668
Uh, dumplings!

809
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:58,422
I mean, Dumpling House.
I mean, restaurants in general.

810
00:45:58,505 --> 00:45:59,339
All of them.

811
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:02,885
Ah, a young man of means, I see.
Reminds me of myself.

812
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:04,595
You two should have lunch.

813
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:06,054
-Dad!
-Uh, yes.

814
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:09,099
-Of course. I'd love that.
-Excellent.

815
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:12,186
Let's have arrangements made.
Forgive my manners.

816
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:13,687
I didn't get your name.

817
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:14,938
Oh, I'm…

818
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:19,568
-Dan.
-Pleasure to meet you, Dan.

819
00:46:19,651 --> 00:46:21,445
Where would you like to go?

820
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:24,615
The Pearl Tower's excellent.
I have a reservation--

821
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:29,995
-Excuse me, sir. A very important call.
-Just give me a few minutes.

822
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:32,956
Sir, they said they need to talk now.

823
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,125
[sighs] Put them on.

824
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:38,420
Good evening, sorry to keep you waiting.

825
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,466
So, um, would you really like to--

826
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:44,760
Yes. Yeah. [chuckles]

827
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:47,054
See you tomorrow, Dan.

828
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:52,309
We talked and it was just like old times.

829
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:55,354
We made arrangements
to have lunch. Can you believe it?

830
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:57,773
I can't believe
you didn't explain what a toilet is.

831
00:46:57,856 --> 00:46:59,358
Everything is going to plan!

832
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:01,485
Oh, really, Dan.

833
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:04,863
Uh, I'll come clean when the time's right.

834
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:07,783
You're not gonna,
because there is no right time.

835
00:47:07,866 --> 00:47:10,494
You're the peasant, she's the princess.

836
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:13,539
Tale as old as time.
And we all know how that ends.

837
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:17,501
-Good?
-No, not good. Terribly. Horribly!

838
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:22,047
Long, we have a special bond
that runs deeper than money or status.

839
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:23,173
Why'd you lie?

840
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:25,092
Well, I… uh…

841
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:26,176
I'll tell you.

842
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:30,681
Because the minute Li Na finds out
who you are, this will all fall apart.

843
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:33,517
You should learn
to have faith in humanity.

844
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:37,646
I've been around for 1,000 years.
I know how humans work. Not you.

845
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:40,899
-Poor Long. I see your problem.
-You're my problem.

846
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:43,902
I wouldn't expect your tiny,
reptilian brain to understand

847
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:45,696
the power of human friendship.

848
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:49,283
It's okay. I'll be your first
and only friend. Come here.

849
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:52,202
I had a million friends
when I was human. Oh, no.

850
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:54,913
Long,

851
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:57,708
-were you a--
-Yes, yes, I was human.

852
00:47:57,791 --> 00:48:00,961
For heaven's sake,
have you even looked at the teapot?

853
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:03,672
And I was the best human ever!

854
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:08,093
One of the most beloved, respected lords
in history! You know why?

855
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:11,054
-You had a lot of friends?
-No!

856
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:15,267
I had all the wealth and land and power,
and everyone loved me for it.

857
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:18,979
Wait, if you're so great,
why haven't I heard of you?

858
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:24,026
We-- Well, obviously some jealous rival
took credit for everything after I died.

859
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:27,654
You died.
The heavens made you a Wish Dragon?

860
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,323
Yes, as a reward.

861
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:32,534
-You don't seem happy.
-I'm very happy.

862
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:35,037
So, if you would just use your last wish,

863
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:38,457
and wish for the same thing
as every other master,

864
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:39,666
then I can be done

865
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,002
and leave this wretched world.

866
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:44,212
And finally return back to heaven,

867
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:48,634
where everyone is waiting to welcome
the great emperor home with a parade.

868
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:52,304
They have parades in heaven?

869
00:48:52,387 --> 00:48:53,388
[Long sighs]

870
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:57,643
My point is there's a simple solution
to every problem in the world.

871
00:48:57,726 --> 00:48:59,436
Including yours. Use it.

872
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:04,900
So, that's what you've learned
after all these years?

873
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:06,401
Yes.

874
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:13,075
-[watch chimes]
-[gasps]

875
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:15,786
Crap, ten o'clock?
My mom's getting off work.

876
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:18,330
Long, we gotta go! Hurry! Let's go!

877
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:19,998
[groans]

878
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:23,752
[Mr. Wang] Sir, surely you can
extend the loan one more week.

879
00:49:23,835 --> 00:49:26,088
I promise, I can pay you back, sir.

880
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:29,174
Foreclosure?
Please, sir. I'm begging you.

881
00:49:29,257 --> 00:49:31,551
This company is my life's work.

882
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:33,512
I have a family and a respons--

883
00:49:33,595 --> 00:49:35,013
[disconnect tone drones]

884
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:37,808
-Is everything all right, sir?
-It's fine.

885
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:39,184
Just…

886
00:49:39,726 --> 00:49:42,229
just don't tell Li Na about any of this.

887
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:47,526
[sighs]

888
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:08,672
Well, have you found it?

889
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:11,091
We've located the boy's apartment, sir.

890
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:12,092
Yes, and?

891
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:15,971
There's no way he can come or go
without being caught.

892
00:50:16,054 --> 00:50:16,888
Good.

893
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,979
Okay, in the teapot. Everything's normal.

894
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:26,857
-Lights on.
-Think you can bring Li Na to this dump?

895
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,442
Quiet, you! Homework out.

896
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:30,402
Her fridge is bigger than this apartment.

897
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:34,239
If you're not gonna say
something helpful, don't say anything.

898
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:35,574
She's here!

899
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:38,869
Uh, your suit.

900
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:40,495
Huh? Oh, no!

901
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:41,580
[fabric rips]

902
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:44,374
Din, I brought you some…

903
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:48,378
Hello, Mother.
Sure is hot out tonight, isn't it?

904
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:52,090
No, it's freezing.
You coming down with something?

905
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:54,843
Oh, no. Just… studying.

906
00:50:54,926 --> 00:50:56,887
Okay. Here.

907
00:50:56,970 --> 00:51:00,724
-I'll heat you up some leftovers.
-Li Na will love leftovers.

908
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:02,392
-Hey, stop it!
-Stop what?

909
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:06,313
Uh, stop worrying about me. I'm fine.

910
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:07,898
You don't seem fine.

911
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:11,401
-How was school?
-Great. School was great.

912
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:13,361
You lie to everyone, not just yourself.

913
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:14,863
-Leave me alone.
-Fine.

914
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:17,699
[gasps] No, Mom. I was just…

915
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:22,954
-You know where to find me.
-…talking to somebody else.

916
00:51:23,538 --> 00:51:26,166
Din, I'm going to ask you a question.

917
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:28,293
Remember, I'm your mother.

918
00:51:28,376 --> 00:51:30,087
You can tell me the truth.

919
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:31,630
Uh-huh.

920
00:51:31,713 --> 00:51:33,465
Are you…

921
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:35,926
drinking alcohol?

922
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:39,513
-No. Gimme that! I'm not drinking.
-Where are you hiding it?

923
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:43,100
Don't lie to me!
Staying out late! Skipping school!

924
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:45,519
-You're acting crazy all the time.
-Mom!

925
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:48,772
I am your mother!
I know when something is wrong.

926
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:50,649
-What is it?
-Nothing is wrong!

927
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:53,860
Just tell me the truth.
Whatever it is, I can help.

928
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:55,904
Mom, you can't.

929
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:57,656
Believe me.

930
00:51:58,532 --> 00:51:59,366
You can't.

931
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:01,493
Go to your room.

932
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:03,787
Don't come out
if you're going to disrespect me.

933
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:04,996
-I wasn't--
-Go!

934
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:05,914
Fine!

935
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:10,961
[groans] I hate this place.

936
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:19,010
-They're really going at it.
-Bring that chair.

937
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:20,220
Popcorn, anyone?

938
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:21,638
I can hear you.

939
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:23,098
[neighbors clamoring]

940
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:25,100
[poignant music playing]

941
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:27,394
[Din's mom] Din.

942
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:29,396
Here.

943
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:35,485
You…

944
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:38,446
you need a real dinner.

945
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:40,574
Thanks.

946
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:42,659
Sorry, Mom.

947
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,086
[slurps]

948
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:12,522
Hey, little buddy. You're so cute.
You have family? Are you hungry?

949
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:16,234
You're such a cute, fluffy,
little, hairy-faced… [babbling]

950
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:19,154
-It's him! Wake up!
-Huh? Huh?

951
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:21,364
-Hey, boss! Boss!
-Hey, boss!

952
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:23,533
-[short henchman] Boss!
-The boy!

953
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:25,619
[intense music plays]

954
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:31,541
[engine revs]

955
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:38,548
Impossible.

956
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:46,264
Okay, Din. You can do this.

957
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:47,974
Just tell her the truth.

958
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:50,185
-[elevator dings]
-Good evening, sir.

959
00:53:53,104 --> 00:53:55,106
-Oh, hey, Dan!
-Hey!

960
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:59,236
-Sir, may I take your jacket?
-My jacket? I just got this.

961
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:01,363
[chuckles] Good one, Dan.

962
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:03,990
[chuckles] Yeah, good one.

963
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:06,701
Sure. I have plenty more of these at home.

964
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:09,913
-Thank you. Here you are.
-Here.

965
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:14,334
Sorry about all the fuss.

966
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:16,503
My dad insists on "only the best."

967
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:21,591
Actually, Li Na,
there's something I need to tell you.

968
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:23,468
I know what you're gonna say.

969
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:24,636
-You do?
-Yes.

970
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,973
It's so nice to meet someone
from a respectable family

971
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:30,433
that you enjoy talking to, right?

972
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:32,978
-Oh.
-Madame, your table is ready.

973
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,522
Right. Respectable.

974
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:39,234
Long, I'm supposed to be
from a respectable family.

975
00:54:39,317 --> 00:54:42,737
No. What? I'm shocked. I'm stunned.

976
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:45,865
-It's exactly what I predicted.
-I need your help.

977
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:48,618
You were from royalty. Tell me what to do.

978
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:50,829
Fine. Do exactly what I say.

979
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:53,957
-Okay. Deal.
-Sir, could I offer you a hot tow--

980
00:54:54,499 --> 00:54:56,960
You shouldn't let
commoners talk to you.

981
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:58,503
-Really?
-Sir, I just--

982
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:01,965
wanted to offer you a hot towel.

983
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:03,633
Sir, you just--

984
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:04,843
[shushes]

985
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,220
Madame, your table.

986
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:10,140
Demand another table,
claiming it's far superior.

987
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:15,770
Li Na, this table simply won't do.
Allow me to show you another one.

988
00:55:16,604 --> 00:55:18,982
This is the table
for the hors d'oeuvres.

989
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:24,946
Well, you tell Mr. and Mrs. Hors D'oeuvres
that this is our table.

990
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:25,947
[Li Na laughs]

991
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:27,824
Dan, you're such a funny guy.

992
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:29,242
[laughs] Funny?

993
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:33,955
Uh, are you sure you didn't mean
suave, classy, respectable.

994
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:35,665
[laughing]

995
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,669
You're too good. I'm gonna cry.

996
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:43,089
I would have her executed
for mocking royalty.

997
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:46,468
I appreciate you trying
to make this place interesting,

998
00:55:46,551 --> 00:55:48,345
but how about somewhere else?

999
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:51,222
Somewhere else? Like more fancy than this?

1000
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:52,474
Not good enough?

1001
00:55:52,557 --> 00:55:55,810
-Well played, child.
-No, like, a walk or something.

1002
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:57,604
May I take your order?

1003
00:55:57,687 --> 00:56:01,191
-Spare no expense. Money's no object.
-One of everything.

1004
00:56:01,816 --> 00:56:04,402
Sir, there are over 600 items on our menu.

1005
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:06,780
-Better make that three.
-Good!

1006
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:07,989
As you wish, sir.

1007
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:10,825
So, listen, Dan, about last night,

1008
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:13,620
sorry for acting so weird.

1009
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:16,998
To be honest, it's nice
to have someone who listened.

1010
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:18,833
Ignore her and she's yours.

1011
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:22,879
Look. Rich people
never pay attention to anyone else.

1012
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:26,257
All they talk about is their own business,
how much money they make.

1013
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:30,595
-It's almost an art form.
-Are you listening to anything I said?

1014
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:33,348
Not a word.

1015
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:38,645
Um, okay, well, I was saying
it was really nice to talk to you…

1016
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:41,898
We're close, Din.
Tell her how many palaces you own.

1017
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:45,819
Let me stop you. Did I tell you
just how respectable my family is?

1018
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:47,529
-Your first entree.
-Thanks.

1019
00:56:47,612 --> 00:56:48,488
Uh-uh-uh.

1020
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:49,781
For nothing.

1021
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:52,450
Dan! You know what?

1022
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:56,162
-You're just not who I thought you were.
-Wait, Li Na.

1023
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:58,998
I don't understand.
That worked on all 17 of my wives.

1024
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:00,917
-I can explain.
-What now?

1025
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,168
I, uh…

1026
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:03,086
We should…

1027
00:57:03,795 --> 00:57:05,922
We should go for that walk.

1028
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:09,342
Maybe a run!

1029
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:11,970
Bon appetit!

1030
00:57:12,053 --> 00:57:13,304
Surprise!

1031
00:57:17,642 --> 00:57:18,601
Hop on.

1032
00:57:22,021 --> 00:57:22,981
Fine.

1033
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:25,984
Who were those men?

1034
00:57:26,067 --> 00:57:28,736
Gangsters.
Probably out to kidnap us for a ransom.

1035
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:30,822
[crowd clapping, cheering]

1036
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:38,371
-Come on. This way.
-[exciting music playing]

1037
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:40,123
Oh, no.

1038
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:42,792
You've always wanted
to be in a street fight.

1039
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:43,877
-Help.
-[Long] No!

1040
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:46,004
-Stay calm.
-[Din] Come on, please.

1041
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:47,380
-Dan?
-[Long groans]

1042
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:50,508
Look what I found! [laughs]

1043
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:52,594
[exciting percussive music plays]

1044
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:57,599
[Long] Look at me.
How did I become a piñata?

1045
00:57:57,682 --> 00:57:59,476
-I think we lost them.
-Good.

1046
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:02,562
So, when exactly
were you going to apologize, Dan?

1047
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:03,480
I…

1048
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:06,691
Huh?

1049
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:07,775
[crowd gasp]

1050
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,112
The other way! Other way!

1051
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:14,532
[cheering]

1052
00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:19,120
Li Na, I really do want to say I'm sorry.

1053
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:20,622
Sorry for what exactly?

1054
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:23,708
Sorry for acting like such a jerk.

1055
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:25,084
Apology accepted.

1056
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:28,379
Now, get him, Dan.
Kick him right in his stupid face!

1057
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:29,464
Kick him!

1058
00:58:29,547 --> 00:58:30,840
[Long spluttering]

1059
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:32,050
[crowd winces]

1060
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:35,386
Hand over the teapot, kid.

1061
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:37,597
[chuckling]

1062
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:45,104
I didn't sign up for this.
If you made your last wish, we-- Oh, no.

1063
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:51,569
This literally could not get any wo--

1064
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:53,154
[Long vomiting wetly]

1065
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:57,992
-Good one.
-Ah. Thanks.

1066
00:58:58,076 --> 00:58:59,536
Eat metal, dirt bag!

1067
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:01,621
How do you like them apples, huh?

1068
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:03,790
Crap!

1069
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:12,382
[Li Na] Incoming!

1070
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:32,193
Trust me.

1071
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:35,655
-Li Na, I think we're gonna have to--
-Jump!

1072
00:59:36,781 --> 00:59:38,032
[Li Na, Din yelping]

1073
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:43,454
Don't worry. We got this.

1074
00:59:53,339 --> 00:59:54,632
[both exclaiming]

1075
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:58,386
[Din] Oh, no!

1076
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:00,263
[Li Na] Oh, my God!

1077
01:00:00,346 --> 01:00:02,307
[triumphant music plays]

1078
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:11,107
You know what, Dan?
This is turning into a pretty good date.

1079
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:14,152
[Long] Oh, no!

1080
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:26,414
[both coughing]

1081
01:00:27,915 --> 01:00:30,501
-Are you okay?
-I think so.

1082
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:33,880
[both chuckling]

1083
01:00:37,592 --> 01:00:39,927
[Long] I'm fine. Thank you for asking.

1084
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:44,098
Oh, boy.

1085
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,059
What happened?

1086
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:47,477
Time's up, Dan.

1087
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:50,563
What happened?
Well, we jumped off a building.

1088
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:51,898
We almost died.

1089
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:54,776
-Your 24 hours are over.
-We beat up some gangsters.

1090
01:00:54,859 --> 01:00:56,903
-No.
-Okay, that was mostly you.

1091
01:00:56,986 --> 01:00:59,364
You gotta teach me some of that kung fu.

1092
01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:02,367
Whoops.

1093
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:03,701
Reflexes.

1094
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:07,830
Wait, what happened to your suit?

1095
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:11,751
Look, Li Na.

1096
01:01:14,045 --> 01:01:17,215
There's… something I need to tell you.

1097
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:19,550
You have one more wish.
You don't have to do this.

1098
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:24,389
My real name isn't Dan.

1099
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:25,306
It's…

1100
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:26,724
[Li Na] Din.

1101
01:01:28,434 --> 01:01:29,435
You're Din.

1102
01:01:30,144 --> 01:01:31,896
[groans]

1103
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:33,648
I'm sorry.

1104
01:01:33,731 --> 01:01:36,359
But… why did you lie?

1105
01:01:36,442 --> 01:01:38,569
I wasn't planning to. I just…

1106
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:44,200
I was worried that if you found out
it was, well, just me,

1107
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:46,411
everything would end.

1108
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:51,332
So, you still live around here?

1109
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:52,875
Yeah.

1110
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:55,753
In that same old shikumen?

1111
01:01:56,629 --> 01:01:57,463
Yeah.

1112
01:01:58,172 --> 01:02:00,174
I told you this wouldn't end well.

1113
01:02:01,342 --> 01:02:02,176
[Li Na] Wait.

1114
01:02:02,677 --> 01:02:04,178
I remember this alley.

1115
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:08,975
We used to take a shortcut through here
on the way home from school.

1116
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:10,601
Uh, yeah.

1117
01:02:10,685 --> 01:02:13,563
And Mrs. Chu would sell
those roasted yams.

1118
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:16,858
Hey, look at that! It's Mrs. Chu!

1119
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:19,152
Hi, Mrs. Chu. It's Li Na Wang.

1120
01:02:19,235 --> 01:02:21,654
-Do you remember--
-One buck, two yams. No bargaining!

1121
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:24,323
-Some things never change.
-Here.

1122
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:25,950
[Mrs. Chu] Sold! Next.

1123
01:02:26,033 --> 01:02:27,618
-Ow, ow.
-[Mrs. Chu] Move!

1124
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:30,496
So good!

1125
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:32,415
Hold on, is that…

1126
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:34,667
[Mrs. Chu] Huh?

1127
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:36,252
[bright, uplifting music]

1128
01:02:36,335 --> 01:02:38,171
[women chanting]

1129
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:39,589
No way! [Li Na laughs]

1130
01:02:39,672 --> 01:02:42,341
Yeah, new decade, same sweatpants!

1131
01:02:46,804 --> 01:02:49,640
Hey, Din, what do you think
about a little race?

1132
01:02:49,724 --> 01:02:51,350
-Three, two, one, go!
-What?

1133
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:52,602
[Din] Hey!

1134
01:02:52,685 --> 01:02:53,895
[Li Na grunts] Ah!

1135
01:02:56,397 --> 01:02:57,231
Okay.

1136
01:02:57,732 --> 01:02:58,816
Not fair.

1137
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:12,121
So, your old apartment
has to be right around the corner.

1138
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:16,250
Oh, I don't know
if that's such a good idea.

1139
01:03:16,334 --> 01:03:19,670
-Hey Weijing, you have any green onions?
-Hi, Mrs. Song.

1140
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:22,089
I'm sorry. Do I know you?

1141
01:03:22,173 --> 01:03:25,009
Hey, Mom. So, uh, surprise!

1142
01:03:25,092 --> 01:03:28,262
We have an unexpected visitor.

1143
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:34,477
A girl? That's why you're acting crazy?

1144
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:39,398
All this time worried you were drugged out
in some internet cafe. It was a girl.

1145
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:41,025
-It's Li Na!
-Just a--

1146
01:03:43,027 --> 01:03:44,070
Hi.

1147
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:46,823
Li Na? What are you doing here?

1148
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:50,326
Just visiting an old friend.

1149
01:03:51,369 --> 01:03:52,203
Oh.

1150
01:03:52,286 --> 01:03:56,082
[Mrs. Song grunts]
Well, where are my manners? Come in.

1151
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:58,042
You and I are not finished.

1152
01:03:58,584 --> 01:04:01,379
-She's so pretty now.
-Like a princess.

1153
01:04:01,462 --> 01:04:03,422
Well, her nose is a little flat.

1154
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:05,174
[Mrs. Song] Start with this.

1155
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:09,220
-You really shouldn't go to--
-You're skinnier than a broom handle.

1156
01:04:09,303 --> 01:04:11,347
-I wasn't expecting--
-Li Na!

1157
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:15,017
Did you know Din puts flowers
on Clucky's grave every year?

1158
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:16,727
Mr. Huang, cut it out.

1159
01:04:16,811 --> 01:04:18,271
I did not know that.

1160
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:20,606
He's so cute. He even cries a little.

1161
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:23,234
I am not crying. I am mourning.

1162
01:04:23,317 --> 01:04:26,362
-He even brings flowers.
-A tiny bouquet!

1163
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:29,282
[muffled chatter]

1164
01:04:31,158 --> 01:04:35,329
[woman singing romantically in Chinese]

1165
01:05:09,655 --> 01:05:10,656
Come in.

1166
01:05:13,367 --> 01:05:14,368
[song fades away]

1167
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:18,831
What? You're saying that's not my son?

1168
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:20,750
You knew. Don't lie to me.

1169
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:23,377
[man] You were lying to me
this whole time.

1170
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:26,672
You just wanted
to inherit my dad's business.

1171
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:29,425
-[woman] Right. I will.
-I know what you did!

1172
01:05:29,508 --> 01:05:32,678
You think you can fool me?
I saw you with that guy.

1173
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:34,430
[woman] You have no idea.

1174
01:05:34,513 --> 01:05:36,557
I should've
listened to my mother.

1175
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:38,392
-I am your mother.
-No!

1176
01:05:38,476 --> 01:05:39,852
[all gasp]

1177
01:05:41,228 --> 01:05:42,063
Here.

1178
01:05:43,397 --> 01:05:46,442
Oh, wow. Oh!
It's like a time machine up here.

1179
01:05:46,525 --> 01:05:50,488
Yeah, sorry. This is the only place
I can get peace and quiet.

1180
01:05:50,571 --> 01:05:52,490
[Li Na] You'll never have peace.

1181
01:05:52,573 --> 01:05:55,534
Because the ghost
of Clucky will always haunt you!

1182
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:57,703
-[clucks]
-No, Clucky! You're dead.

1183
01:05:57,787 --> 01:06:00,456
Are you gonna cry?
Are we gonna see tears now?

1184
01:06:00,539 --> 01:06:02,249
I regret nothing. You were delicious.

1185
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:05,127
You're gonna know
what regret tastes like.

1186
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:07,421
Get away from me, you ghost chicken.

1187
01:06:07,505 --> 01:06:10,633
-Why did you eat me?
-It was Li Na. She made me do it.

1188
01:06:11,425 --> 01:06:12,718
Selling me out.

1189
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:14,971
-That's cold.
-It was your idea.

1190
01:06:15,054 --> 01:06:19,266
Yeah. I guess we had
a lot of crazy ideas back then.

1191
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:21,227
Yeah.

1192
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:24,188
-[shivers]
-Huh? Oh!

1193
01:06:24,271 --> 01:06:25,106
Here.

1194
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:30,486
[both sigh]

1195
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:34,198
Hey, do you remember that promise we made?

1196
01:06:34,281 --> 01:06:36,200
-The pinky--
-Of course!

1197
01:06:36,283 --> 01:06:37,535
How'd it go? Um…

1198
01:06:37,618 --> 01:06:40,496
Friends forever, day by…

1199
01:06:40,579 --> 01:06:42,581
[both] Year by year,

1200
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:44,875
upon this we will always…

1201
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:47,169
swear.

1202
01:06:52,717 --> 01:06:54,051
[billboard buzzes]

1203
01:06:55,094 --> 01:06:56,095
-Oh!
-Whoa!

1204
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:57,555
-God!
-Are you okay?

1205
01:06:57,638 --> 01:06:59,223
I'm fine. I'm fine.

1206
01:07:00,141 --> 01:07:03,602
Sorry, I wasn't expecting
my own giant face.

1207
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:04,812
So embarrassing.

1208
01:07:04,895 --> 01:07:09,442
[chuckles] Don't be embarrassed.
When I first saw that, I almost fell over.

1209
01:07:10,735 --> 01:07:13,946
But it's been nice.
Kind of like you were back.

1210
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:17,825
But, you know, giant and glowing,
and super glamorous.

1211
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:21,537
Doesn't hold a candle
to the real thing, though.

1212
01:07:25,207 --> 01:07:27,752
What do you say we go for a real date?

1213
01:07:27,835 --> 01:07:30,421
No Dan or any of that.

1214
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:31,964
I…

1215
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:34,216
[phone rings]

1216
01:07:35,509 --> 01:07:36,385

Din…

1221
01:07:50,191 --> 01:07:54,070
I had a really wonderful time tonight,

1222
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:56,447
but I have to go.

1223
01:07:56,947 --> 01:08:00,951
-Thanks for letting me borrow this.
-Keep it till next time.

1224

No, really, I--

Din,

1228
01:08:11,212 --> 01:08:16,008
the truth is,
I have this whole other life now.

1229
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:18,344
You know? A career.

1230
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:22,264
A future that my dad
worked really hard for.

1231
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:27,061
Certain expectations I have to meet.

1232

Let me guess.

1233

I don't meet those expectations.

You don't understand.

I… I'm just trying to be…

1237
01:08:39,698 --> 01:08:40,825

1238

Hey, Din.

1241
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:11,522
Did you know that shrimp chips

1242
01:09:11,605 --> 01:09:14,650
don't actually have any shrimp
in the ingredients?

1243
01:09:15,609 --> 01:09:16,443
Okay.

1244
01:09:23,242 --> 01:09:24,243
Din…

1245
01:09:27,121 --> 01:09:30,708
…things are simpler when you're children.

1246
01:09:31,625 --> 01:09:33,419
But you're older now.

1247
01:09:33,919 --> 01:09:36,380
And, well,

1248
01:09:36,463 --> 01:09:38,215
you have to be realistic.

1249
01:09:42,761 --> 01:09:43,596
Din.

1250
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:49,393
Good news, Long.

1251
01:09:50,144 --> 01:09:51,854
You can finally be rid of me.

1252
01:09:52,563 --> 01:09:54,481
I'm ready for my third wish.

1253
01:09:54,565 --> 01:09:55,399
You are?

1254
01:09:55,941 --> 01:09:57,193
Make me rich.

1256
01:09:58,485 --> 01:09:59,820
However you do it.

1257
01:09:59,904 --> 01:10:02,239
-But--
-I thought it wouldn't matter.

1258
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:04,241
That she wouldn't care.

1259
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:07,036
That was stupid.

1260
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:11,624
Give me the gold,
and I can have some of that good life.

1261
01:10:11,707 --> 01:10:13,876
People will treat me with respect.

1262
01:10:14,793 --> 01:10:18,005
Heck, I'm sure everyone will want
to be my friend then.

Are you sure?

1265
01:10:21,383 --> 01:10:25,721
Am I sure? You've been telling me
to make this wish since we met.

1266
01:10:25,804 --> 01:10:28,390
Well, you were right. Okay? I was wrong.

1267
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:30,226
There you go, that's my wish.

1268
01:10:30,309 --> 01:10:33,520
Just grant it, and you can
go back to your spirit world

Din, I'll grant your wish.

1275

But first,
there's something I need to show you.

1276
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:10,307
You found the boy. Where is he?

1277
01:11:10,391 --> 01:11:13,143
-At the Pearl Tower, sir.
-Yeah, with a girl.

1278

-But I'm afraid he escaped again.
-What? How?

-I'm sorry, Dad. We really need to talk.

1283
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:34,123
Of course.

-I'm just on a very important call.
-Dad.

1285
01:11:37,501 --> 01:11:38,669
Please.

[bald man] Sir.

1287
01:11:41,755 --> 01:11:44,842
Do you remember when we lived
in that old shikumen?

1288
01:11:44,925 --> 01:11:48,304
-I know we didn't have much but--
-Don't worry, Li Na.

1289

We'll never go back to that life.

1290
01:11:50,556 --> 01:11:53,726
But, Dad, don't you ever miss those days?

1291
01:11:53,809 --> 01:11:56,103
Wha-- Where is all this coming from?

1292
01:11:56,687 --> 01:11:58,647

1294

that was Din.

1295
01:12:03,569 --> 01:12:05,195
From our old neighborhood?

1296
01:12:05,779 --> 01:12:06,780
Yes.

1297
01:12:06,864 --> 01:12:10,117
And he's the one who took you
to the Pearl Tower.

1298
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,286
Yes, and I know what you'll say.

1299
01:12:12,369 --> 01:12:16,081
You'll tell me to stay away
and to leave that old world behind,

1300

I think we might be happier if--

I'm gonna go talk with Din.

-[Long] This was my home.

I was born into royalty.

1316
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:23,732
I learned from a young age
that gold is power.

1317
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:27,986
So, I set my sights
on expanding my fortune

1318
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:29,988
and let nothing stand in my way.

1319
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:32,866
My subjects were loyal…

1320
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:38,455
…and worked tirelessly year after year.

And my son,
I sent off to win treasure.

He came home a hero.

1325

than any lord who had come before me.

of loyal subjects and loving family.

1330
01:14:15,951 --> 01:14:17,202

I cursed all who had forgotten me.
